          <h4 className={h4ClassName}>Assumption of Risk</h4>
          <p>
            By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with
            using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and
            intricacies of digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), AVAX, Ethereum (ETH) and other digital tokens such as
            those following the ERC-20 standard. You further understand that the markets for these digital assets are
            highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security,
            and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and
            blockchain-based systems such as Avalanche is variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You
            further acknowledge and accept the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while
            they are supplied to the Protocol through the Interface, you may suffer loss (including without limitation
            divergence risk and "impermanent loss") due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or
            liquidity pool, and, especially in expert modes, experience significant price slippage and cost. You
            understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that
            falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those
            or other tokens. You further acknowledge that we do not vet, qualify, audit, endorse or support tokens
            accessible via the Interface. By using the Interface, you confirm that you have considered and accept the
            risks associated with the purchase of cryptocurrencies and the use of public blockchains, including (without
            limitation) the following risks:
          </p>
          <p>
            Impermanent loss and divergence risk caused by the operation of the constant function market-maker
            algorithm. This algorithm rebalances digital asset pairs in response to price fluctuations and can cause you

            The Interface and Protocol are supplied "as-is" and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, without
            warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We assume no liability or responsibility for any: (a)
            errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature
            whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of the Interface; (c) unauthorized access or use of any secure
            server or database in our control, or the use of any information or data stored therein; (d) interruption or
            cessation of function related to the Interface; (e) bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be
            transmitted to or through the Interface; (f) errors or omissions in, or loss or damage incurred as a result
            of the use of, any content made available through the Interface; and (g) the defamatory, offensive, or

            employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any claims, proceedings,
            liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to us in
            exchange for access to and use of the Interface, or $100.00, whichever is lesser. This limitation of
            liability applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict
            liability, under an indemnity or any other basis, and even if we have been advised of the possibility of
            such liability, loss or damage. Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors,
            employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any indirect, punitive,
            incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of
            revenue, profits, savings, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out of or relating to
            any access or use of the Interface or Protocol, nor will we be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury
            resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Protocol, the Interface or the
            information contained within it. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the
            limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. To the extent that any provision of this
            Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the

            may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
